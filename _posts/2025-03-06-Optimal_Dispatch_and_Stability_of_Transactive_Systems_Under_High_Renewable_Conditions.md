A combination of environmental policy and falling production costs has led to
the proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs) in electric power
systems. Transactive energy has emerged as a fundamentally new approach to
managing electric energy delivery in systems with very high levels of DERs.
In this paper we address the question "Can we prove the optimality and
stability of general transactive energy systems?" To better understand,
observe and control the behavior of transactive control systems we generalize
an existing solution to the optimal dispatch function that minimizes the cost
objective function in a system with an energy storage price, a power
capability price and a ramping response price. We use this generalization to
model the behavior of a transactive system that maximizes economic surplus.
The Lagrangian solution allows us to derive a Hamiltonian formulation, which
we use to explore the properties of the model transactive system. We use this
result to derive a linear relationship between the surplus maximizing power
dispatch and ramping price. We also find that transactive systems with convex
cost functions are always stable but systems with cost functions that have
time dynamics of order two or greater cannot be stable.
