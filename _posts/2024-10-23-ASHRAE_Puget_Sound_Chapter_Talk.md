_David Chassin presents the current research on projections of building electrification impacts to the grid over the next decade._

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Load Modeling Work Group (LMWG) is responsible for advancing and utilizing dynamic load models of electrical loads at the interconnection-level in North America. The LMWG addresses issues related to available dynamic load models, load model datasets and guidelines for load modeling practices, and provides guidance on the future development of dynamic load modeling capabilities across North American.  This talk will focus on the ten-year load forecasts developed at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in support of NERC resource adequacy planning efforts. The discussion will include the impact of load electrification, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and the emergence of data centers as a potential major driver of electric load growth.

The talk is titled "Grid Impact of Building Electrification: Load Modeling and Forecast for the next 10 years" and will be presented during the chapter meeting from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM on October 23, 2024 at the Renaissance Seattle Hotel.
