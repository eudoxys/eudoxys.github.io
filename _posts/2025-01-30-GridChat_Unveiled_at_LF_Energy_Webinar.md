*David Chassin and Pedram Jahangiri from Amazon AWS Energy host LF Energy webinar about GridChat.*

Pedram Jahangiri from Amazon AWS Energy and David Chassin from Eudoxys Sciences LLC hosted an LF Energy webinar about GridChat, a new AI grid modeling assistant for Arras Energy. GridChat features a large-language model trained on the Arras Energy documentation and resources. It produces answers with citations to the source for the response. Questions can include requests for source code and help with simulation debugging issues. GridChat allows for dialogues by maintaining a context and responding to follow-ups in that context.  To register to use GridChat, visit the [GridChat Website](https://gridchat.gridlabd.us/).
