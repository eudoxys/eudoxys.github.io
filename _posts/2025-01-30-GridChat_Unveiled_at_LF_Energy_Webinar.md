*David Chassin and Pedram Jahangiri from Amazon Web Services (AWS) host LF Energy webinar about GridChat.*

Pedram Jahangiri from AWS and David Chassin from Eudoxys Sciences LLC hosted an LF Energy webinar about GridChat, a GenAI-powered assistant for Arras Energy. 

Unlike traditional models trained on static data, GridChat leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with an up-to-date knowledge base of Arras Energy documentation and resources. It retrieves relevant information dynamically and provides answers with citations to ensure accuracy and transparency. Users can ask questions about GLM syntax, simulation debugging, and source code, with GridChat maintaining context for follow-up interactions.
