*David Chassin presents an update on Arras Energy at the LF Energy Summit in Brussels Belgium.*

Arras Energy is LF Energy's version of the US Department of Energy and the California Energy Commission's power system simulation used to study smart grid technology, renewable energy integration, climate change, and deep electrification impacts on electricity infrastructure. This talk will review the history and motivation for GridLAB-D, the technology used by Arras Energy, present common use cases for Arras Energy, and discuss some of the current challenges and opportunities that face open-source software solutions like Arras Energy as they are increasingly adopted by utilities in the United States.
