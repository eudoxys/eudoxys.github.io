_Eudoxys Sciences releases `loads` developer tools to access US state and county electric load data_.

The `loads` package provides state and county electric load data for use with [Arras Energy](https://www.arras.energy/), [pypower](https://www.eudoxys.com/pypower_sim) and other bulk power system simulations. Data for residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural loads can be downloaded and used to construct Pandas dataframes and CSV files for hourly load time-series simulations.

For more information, see the [Eudoxys `loads` documentation](https://www.eudoxys.com/loads).
