*Eudoxys Sciences LLC partners with Verdant Associates to provide technical assistance to the California Energy Commission.*

[Verdant Associates](https://verdantassoc.com/) and Eudoxys Sciences LLC will build the stateâ€™s electric distribution grid model to assist the CEC in assessing various electrification and distributed energy resource (DER) adoption scenarios. Eudoxys has teamed up with Verdant to use the open-source software [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) [Arras Energy](https://arras.energy), and evaluate the reliability, equity and cost implications of emerging DER integration strategies. Eudoxys will lead the distribution system modeling and staff training using the tool developed under this project to analyze current and future data as the electric distribution grid evolves.

See [CEC RFP-24-801](https://www.energy.ca.gov/solicitations/2024-10/rfp-24-801-distributed-energy-and-electrification-analysis) for details.
